            2. Conditions for Authorization
          </h2>
          <p>
            We institute strict conditions upon which a return payload will be
            authorized for processing:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              <strong>Intact State:</strong> Merchandise must arrive back at our
              inspection facilities in unworn, unwashed, and original condition.
              Tags must be mathematically unbroken.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Proof of Action:</strong> Legitimate Order ID protocols
              must be provided to the Inspireshop verification network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quality Flags:</strong> Items displaying fraudulent
              tampering, extreme neglect, or distinct external wear are
              permanently barred from the return pipeline without refunds.

            3. Excluded Asset Classes
          </h2>
          <p>
            Strict health directives require that the following assets are
            categorically unreturnable once the protective seal algorithm is
            breached: Unsealed electronics, undergarments, food
            products/groceries, and personalized <em>Customise</em> orders.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Once a unit crosses an authorized intake center, it will undergo a
            rigorous validation screening. Approved credits will be
            algorithmically routed to the originating payment gateway within a
            span of 5-7 continuous business days.

          <p>
            If a package breach occurs mid-transit, lodge an instantaneous
            protocol error with <strong>support@inspireshop.com</strong> with
            cryptographic proof (clear photographs). Our response team will
