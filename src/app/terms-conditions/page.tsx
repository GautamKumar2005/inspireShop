          </h2>
          <p>
            Transactions orchestrated under the Inspireshop infrastructure
            constitute legally binding agreements. Fraudulent chargebacks,
            abusive language, or systemic abuse compromises Inspireshop
            operations and may be escalated to regional law enforcement.

            The branding, software execution, layout algorithms, and trade
            dresses comprising <strong>Inspireshop</strong> are strictly
            proprietary property. Unauthorized scraping, replication, or

          <p>
            Inspireshop functions as a centralized marketplace. We govern the
            infrastructure but accept no sweeping liability for systemic
            failures resulting from forces outside technological boundaries (Act
            of God).
